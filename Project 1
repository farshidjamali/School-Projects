Title: Develop a relational database for a health clinic.
Design and develop a relational database for a health clinic. This database will be used for three purposes:
-Keep track of employees who work for the clinic
-Keep track of patients who receive various services from the clinic
-Keep track of suppliers (vendors) who provide the clinic with a variety of medical consumables* and drugs/medications along with the present supply inventory levels in the clinic.
*Consumables are medical supplies like syringes and needles, gauze, medical gloves, masks, etc.
The implementation of the relational database will be done using PostgreSQL DBMS (database management system).


A relational database is designed, developed, and implemented (on a remote server) for a health clinic management system (HCMS), where all the essential information surrounding the employees, patients, and vendors will be recorded and maintained.
The project team collaborated remotely and used GitLab for planning and version control.

This project has three major phases:
(1) business requirements gathering,
Analyzing the requirements and objectives to define all the possible meaningful business queries 
Also, creating a data dictionary that contains all entities, attributes, data types, lengths, and date format 
(2) conceptual and logical design,
Designing an ER diagram with all the entities and relationships and converting it to a logical schema.
(3) database implementation and testing,
We used PostgreSQL to create the tables and populate them with dummy data on the database server.
